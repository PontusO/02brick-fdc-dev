This program was initially meant just to be a test vehicle for the 02Brick
computer, but is slowly turned into a development tool for custom formating
and creating disk images.

Tools:
The project file must be used with Crimson Editor.
All files need to be assembled with DASM.

You need only to assemble the floppy.asm file, all other files are included
by this top file.

GIT usage
Before pushing the tree, open the floppy.prj file in an editor and remove all
absolute paths in the file descriptors. Otherwise all other users will get your
path in their clone.
