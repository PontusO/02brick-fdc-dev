Todo List:

  Today I have been playing a bit with the read sector function, which basically
  seem to be doing what I expect. There is a CRC error generated at the
  beginning of the record, but data can then be read and DRQ's are generated.
  
  To continue debugging I suggest that the next step is to implement a read
  track function so that the raw data can be examined.
  
  The CRC could possibly be a result of the precompensation not being used
  currently. I'll have to look into that.
